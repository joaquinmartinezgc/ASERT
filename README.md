# ASERT
ASERT is a new layout for your QWERTY keyboard. It is intended for people which have been typing in QWERTY keyboards for years and wants to speed it up.

# What is ASERT

*TL;DR, see below.*
*Disclaimer: Not native english speaker, sorry for the mistakes.*

Hi there!. I've touch typing more than 20 years, and during all those years I was thinking of making the leap of faith and changing my keyboard layout to Dvorak, and more recently to Colemak.

Finally for a couple of months I spent a few minutes every day practicing Colemak while still using Querty by default at work, and  **I have failed miserably** . 

Honestly, I wish I liked Colemak, but I have realized that I hate it. I mean, I really do not hate it, but I think it's not for me, because I am human, and by nature I have a rejection of change.

This has made me think about why most QWERTY users never changed to Dvorak, no one wanted to unlearn what they had learned and mastered. And why Colemak has had a partial success, because it adapts QUERTY instead of reinventing it.

BUT, I realized Colemak's defenders lie partly, or cheat, by saying Colemak respects what you learned in Qwerty. 

Let's take for example the case of the [E], which turns out to be the most used key of the keyboard.
In QWERTY the middle finger of the left hand is used to reach this key in the upper row , and Colemak is the right hand and the middle row. All changes of position have been made arbitrarily, and although they are scarce, they are fundamental.

Those who have tested Colemak will have experienced my frustration, searching for letters through the keyboard, when it turns out they are on the opposite side.

Of course, I'm aware that it's my fault, as my muscle memory is hard to change, like most proffesionals out there. As I said before, The human being Resistance to adoption by design. In fact, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#Resistance_to_adoption):

>Although the Dvorak layout is the only other keyboard layout registered with ANSI and is provided with all major operating systems, attempts to convert universally to the Dvorak layout have not succeeded. The failure of the Dvorak layout to displace the QWERTY layout has been the subject of some studies.
>
>A discussion of the Dvorak layout is sometimes used as an exercise by management consultants to illustrate the difficulties of change. The Dvorak layout is often used in economics textbooks as a standard example of network effects, though this approach has been criticized.

So, after some researching, and being inspired by Colemak philosophy, I realized that with a minor changes QWERTY could be an actually great layout.

Facts:

* People are afraid to change their layout (Resistance to adoption).

* The most used letters in english are, in this particular order:  etaoinshrdlcumwfgypbvkjxqz 

* The Reading Teacher's Book of Lists claims that the first 25 words make up about one-third of all printed material in English, and that the first 100 make up about one-half of all written material.

* I made an frecuency analysis of that 25 words, this are the results:

    
    t : 10
    o : 8
    h : 7
    a : 6
    i : 6
    e : 4
    n : 4
    s : 3
    f : 3
    b : 3
    y : 2
    d : 2
    r : 2
    u : 2
    v : 1
    w : 1
    m : 1
    x : 0
    c : 0
    z : 0
    g : 0
    j : 0
    p : 0
    l : 0
    k : 0
    q : 0

* Top 10 most used keys are on the middle and upper row in Qwerty layout, and the are not mutual exclusive for any finger.

So, if you take a look a the top of this list, most of those keys are actually in the middle of the keyboard. In fact, most of the upper row in QWERTY are the top of the most used letter of the most used words. We already have a good layout, but we have the wrong sorting for that rows!!

What I did is just to change one-by-one a 7 pairs of keys, BUT those key are PRESSED BY THE SAME FINGER. so you can easily remember where is the desired letter by heart from the very first minute practicing.

So, finally, **TL;DR:**

I made a few minor changes in QWERTY layout, which I'm flawlessly using right now, and I'm proud to share with you. Introducing:

[The ASERT layout, a better QWERTY layout.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/87bd7efdc1f49e461c2b0d8913a40795)

As you may see, the green keys have been lowed to the middle row, but keeping the same finger for each key, and the red ones, as counterpart, have been raised to the upper row in place the other left.

With this minor changes, the middle row already has the top 10 most used words in english, and the most common word can be written with just four fingers in the center of the board.

It took me no more than 2 days to get used to it, because I only change a few keys, and every keycap is pressed by the same finger you were used to use with a QWERTY layout. 

The best part: **You already know this layout, no need to memorize a new one.**

I hope you enjoy this layout, which I will publish on github as plugins for the most common OS.

Thanks for reading.
